# Linear Regression Predictor

This project is a simple linear regression model implemented in Python using Streamlit and Plotly. It allows users to train a model on synthetic data and visualize the results. Users can also input custom values for model parameters and predictions.

## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Generate data based on a linear function with added noise.
- **Model Training:** Train the linear regression model using gradient descent optimization.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Visualize the data points and the regression line using Plotly.
- **Customizable Model Parameters:** Users can input their own values for the slope and intercept of the model.
- **Prediction Interface:** Enter x-values to receive predicted y-values, displayed both numerically and visually.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python and the following packages:
- Streamlit
- Plotly

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit plotly
